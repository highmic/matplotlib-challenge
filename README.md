Background:

While your data companions rushed off to jobs in finance and government, you remained adamant that science was the way for you. Staying true to your mission, you've joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.


As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.


Some Observations and Inferences from the analysis

•	Data Integrity is very high:
o	Just one duplicate mice in the entire population across all drug regimens 

o	Only one outlier in the population, the infubinol regimen data as shown by the quantitative analysis and boxplots 

o	The proportion of male to female mouse in the population are even


•	Summary Statistics: 
o	Capomulin and Ramicane are the most promising regimen with the lowest average tumor volume. 

o	Both regimens have the highest mouse count as shown in the bar chart


•	Capomulin Regimen Analysis:

o	Line plot: As treatment timepoint increases there is a negative change in tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin 

o	Scatter plot: There is a positive correlation between tumor volume and mouse weight for the mouse population treated with Capomulin 

o	‘Correlation: There is a positive correlation of 84% between mouse weight and tumor volume for the mouse population in the Capomulin regimen 

o	The R-square value of 71% showed that there is a good fit in the tumor volume data and mouse with in the absence of other variables or considerations with 71% of variance in tumor volume explained by the mouse weight.
